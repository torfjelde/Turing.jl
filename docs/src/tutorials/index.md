# Tutorials

This section contains tutorials on how to implement common models in Turing. If you prefer to have an interactive Jupyter notebook, please fork or download the [TuringTutorials](https://github.com/TuringLang/TuringTutorials) repository.


A list of all the tutorials available can be found to the left. The [introduction]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/0-introduction) tutorial contains an introduction to coin flipping with Turing and a brief overview of probabalistic programming.


Tutorials are under continuous development, but there are some older version available at the TuringTutorials within the [`old-notebooks`](https://github.com/TuringLang/TuringTutorials/tree/master/old-notebooks/) section. Some of these were built using prior versions of Turing and may not function correctly, but they can assist in the syntax used for common models.


If there is a tutorial you would like to request, please open an issue on the  [TuringTutorials](https://github.com/TuringLang/TuringTutorials) repository.
